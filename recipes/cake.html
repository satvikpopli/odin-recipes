    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My grams made this cake when I was small and it has always been my mom's favorite cake. Best with fudge icing
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cake flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) bar sweet chocolate, grated</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Reserve 1 tablespoon of the
            cake flour.
            Sift together remaining flour and baking powder. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Toss the chocolate and walnuts with reserved 1 tablespoon of flour. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream
            together the
            butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in
            the flour
            mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Fold in the chocolate and walnuts.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into
            the center
            of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool before frosting.</li>
    </ol>
